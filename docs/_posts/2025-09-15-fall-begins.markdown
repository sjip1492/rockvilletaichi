Our Fall 2025 session starts September 16! Note: if you are thinking about joining, you do not have to wait until a new session begins, newcomers can join at any point in the year.

Hope you all had a great summer, and welcome back!

We will continue to meet every Tuesday from 6:30 to 7:30 PM. Please email us for the location if you are new or returning after a hiatus, as it sometimes changes!

And here is the link to a new Spotify playlist which we may play during the session: [Spotify Link](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1cPXXOrf6Xsq4oetPOlxlf?si=tvHHwVb3QQeskyx0FJhNJg)

Note: you will need a Premium Spotify account to play without commercials between the songs.
