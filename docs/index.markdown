Join Rockville's longest-running Tai Chi class. Our slow and flowing sessions cater to all ages, backgrounds, and fitness levels.

Our classes are free to join. We only share the cost to rent our space.

If you are looking for a gentle, stress-free way to exercise, feel free to join our Tai Chi community. We are beginner friendly and are looking for new members.

We also have yearly brunches which feature traditional Chinese foods and celebrations.

We meet every Tuesday at 6 PM, please email us for location details, as well as any other questions you may have, at rockvilletaichi (at) gmail (dot) com
