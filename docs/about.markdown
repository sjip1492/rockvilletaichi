Rockville Tai Chi was founded in the early 1990s by Mr. E. C. Lee, and has been active ever since. 

This practice emphasizes slow and flowing movements that are accessible to all ages, backgrounds, and fitness levels.

Our classes are free to join. We only share the cost to rent our space.

We also have yearly brunches which feature traditional Chinese foods and celebrations.

If you are looking for a gentle, stress-free way to exercise, feel free to join our Tai Chi community. We are beginner friendly and are accepting new members.
